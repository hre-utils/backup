# Backup

Streamlines periodic backups to a remote server.

## Where we're at

Copy/paste of a previous version of this project.
Also written in bash.

I think it's pretty solid, but I was aiming for a different methodology at the time.
I stand by the clear & concise nature of the prior version--though can certainly improve upon it now.


## Where we gotta go

- [ ] Logging
- [ ] (Lack of) verbocity, too much information currently printed to terminal
- [ ] Standardization with rest of hre-utils
- [ ] Utilization of hre-lib's
